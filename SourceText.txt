It was a very snowy day.

Pip and Posy wanted to go out and play.

So they put on their woolly jumpers, their stripy socks, their puffy coats, and their waterproof boots,
their cosy scarves, and their woollen mittens.

Then they went out into the snow.

Wherever they walked, they left big footprints.

They caught snowflakes on their tongues.

They even made snow angels with big wings. It was such good fun.

Next, they pulled their sledge up to the top of the hill . . .

. . . and zoomed down the other side.

“WHEEE!” they shouted.

Then Posy had an idea.
“Let’s build a snowmouse!” she said.

“But I want a snowrabbit!” said Pip.

“Snowmouse,” said Posy. “SnowRABBIT,” said Pip.

Posy was so cross with Pip that she threw the snowmouse’s head at him.

Oh dear!

Then Pip was so cross with Posy that he pushed her very hard and she fell into the snow.

Oh dear! Now Pip and Posy were very cold and very sad indeed.

Poor Pip! Poor Posy!

Then Posy did a very kind thing.

“I am sorry for making you all snowy, Pip,” she said.

“And I am sorry for pushing you,” said Pip.

They decided to go inside again, where it was nice and warm.

They took off all their wet things.

And then they got out their playdough and made mice AND rabbits. And frogs and pigs and birds, and elephants and cows and giraffes, as well! 

Hooray!
